# Nodejs with Typescript

This project leverages the power of TypeScript for developing Node.js applications. TypeScript brings static typing and advanced JavaScript features to Node.js development, enhancing code quality, readability, and maintainability. By combining the fast, scalable runtime of Node.js with the robust type checking of TypeScript, this project aims to deliver efficient and reliable server-side applications.
